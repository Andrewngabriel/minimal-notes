## Minimal Notes

A simple console application for note taking. You can read, remove and list the notes all from the terminal.

I developed this program to practice node.js
If you see any problems or things that can be improved, feel free to add it in the issues section.

To use the program:
1. Download the files in the repo
2. Run the following command in the terminal once you're in the directory
   ```javascript
   npm install
   ```

After that you should have all the modules I used which are lodash and yargs.

Happy coding!
